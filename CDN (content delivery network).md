A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed network of servers that work together to deliver web content, such as images, videos, and other static and dynamic assets, to users from the server closest to them.

When a user requests a piece of content from a website, the CDN determines which server is the closest to the user, and delivers the content from that server. This results in faster load times and improved user experience.

CDNs also help to reduce the load on the origin server by caching content and serving it from the closest server to the user. This can help to improve website performance and reduce downtime during high-traffic periods.

Overall, a CDN helps to optimize website performance, reduce page load times, and improve the user experience by delivering content from the server closest to the user.
