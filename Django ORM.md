## Introduction 

Django ORM stands for "Object-Relational Mapping" and it is a way to interact with a database using Python code instead of writing SQL queries.

In other words, the Django ORM allows you to define your database schema using Python classes, and then use these classes to create, read, update, and delete records in the database. The ORM takes care of translating your Python code into SQL queries that the database can understand, so you don't have to write raw SQL.

For example, you could define a Python class called "Book" that represents a table in your database, with attributes like "title", "author", and "published_date". You could then use this class to create new book records in the database, search for existing books, update their information, and delete them.

Overall, the Django ORM makes it easier to work with databases in a more "Pythonic" way, without having to deal with low-level SQL syntax.
