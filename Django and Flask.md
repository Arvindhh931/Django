Django and Flask are two popular web frameworks for building web applications using the Python programming language. While both frameworks can be used to build web applications, they differ in several ways, including:

1. **Size and Complexity**: Django is a more comprehensive web framework that includes many built-in features such as an ORM, admin interface, authentication, and URL routing, among others. Flask, on the other hand, is a lightweight framework that is designed to be flexible and easy to use, but requires more third-party packages to be added to enable similar functionality.
    
2. **Database**: Django has its own Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) that is tightly integrated with the framework and supports multiple databases. Flask, on the other hand, requires the use of external packages to connect to databases and does not include its own ORM.
    
3. **Routing**: Django uses a routing system that maps URLs to views or functions, whereas Flask uses a decorator-based routing system that maps URLs to functions.
    
4. **Templating**: Django has its own templating engine that is tightly integrated with the framework and includes many built-in features. Flask, on the other hand, supports multiple templating engines but does not include its own.
    
5. **Scalability**: Django is designed to handle large and complex web applications, with built-in support for caching, background tasks, and other features. Flask, while also capable of handling complex applications, requires more customization and configuration to achieve similar performance levels.
    
In summary, Django is a more comprehensive framework that is best suited for large, complex web applications, while Flask is a lightweight framework that is flexible and easy to use, but requires more third-party packages to add similar functionality.
