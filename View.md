- The view function is a Python function that takes a web request and returns a web response.  
- The response can be the 
	- HTML content of a web page 
	- Error 404 
	- Redirect
	- Image, 
	- XML document 
- It is the user interface, that displays the content of the webpage when we render a website. 
- It is represented by HTML/CSS/Javascript. The view functions are created in the views.py file present inside the folder of each application we create in Django.
